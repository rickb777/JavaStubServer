JavaStubServer [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/tarttelin/JavaStubServer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tarttelin/JavaStubServer/builds)
==============

Stub server is intended to give a mockito-esque feel to a stubbed HTTP server.  This allows you to test
an application that hits external HTTP interfaces as a proper black box.  Take this example
<p>
You have a web application that hits a ReST api to retrieve customer information.  In the web app code, you have
a gateway that calls the ReST api using a real HTTP request.  In a test environment, you don't want to, or cannot
depend on the real ReST api, so you want to have a fake server that provides canned data back.  This is what
StubServer is intended to simplify for you.

Example test:<br>
  Deploy your web app with a config file that declares that the ReST api is accessible on http://localhost:21435</li>
```
  StubServer server = new StubServer(21435); // matching port
  server.start();
  server.expect(get("/api/customer/Bob")).thenReturn(200, "application/xml","<customer><name>Bob</name></customer>");
  // can have multiple expectations. The url is actually a regex
  try {
     selenium.open("http://localhost:8080/users/?name=Bob");
     //assertions that Bob has the right values as returned from the external ReST api
     server.verify(); // check that all expectations were called
  } finally {
     server.stop();
  }
```
With this approach, it feels more like a unit test, but it allows you to totally black box the system under test.
